        <h3>Discovering Who Jesus Is</h3>
        <p class="font">

          
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world knows that 2,000 years ago a man named Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in what is now called Israel. He traveled about the region and gained a large following. After a few years, the religious leaders in Jerusalem falsely accused him of crimes and handed him over to the Roman authorities. They executed him by nailing him to a cross. A short time later, his followers preached in the name of Jesus Christ, whom they said rose from the dead. More and more followers were added to this movement which has become the Christian church of today.

These are the facts upon which even the greatest skeptic will agree. But there is so much more to Jesus than that. Where he came from, what he did on earth, what he can do for us now is all revealed in the Bible. This book contains the only record of Jesus and was written by the generation of people who heard him teach and saw his deeds. Here is what the Bible teaches us about Jesus Christ:

</p>
<br>
<h3> 1. JESUS IS GOD.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John wrote about Him: In the beginning was the Word [poetic description of Jesus], and the Word was with God and the Word was God (John 1:1 ESV). He created the world and all that is in it (John 1:3). The religious leaders of his time understood that Jesus claimed to be God (John 5:17-18). Paul wrote that when Jesus died, the Father revealed to the entire world that He was God (Philippians 2:5-11).
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>2. JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to the Bible, “Son of God” means: (1) He is fully God. (2) He is one of three persons who together make up the One God. This concept is called the “Trinity.”

The religious leaders of Jesus’ time understood this concept: This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. (John 5:18 ESV)
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>3. JESUS BECAME HUMAN THROUGH THE VIRGIN BIRTH.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eternal Son of God already existed in heaven (John 17:5). Through the power of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:20), He was born as a human being, who was then named Jesus (Matthew 1:25). To demonstrate that Jesus was not a mere man (Colossians 2:9), God chose a virgin to give birth to Him (Luke 1:34-35).
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>4. JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anytime we disobey God is called sin. The penalty for sin is death, but God in his love wants us to live. Therefore, he sent the promised Messiah (also called Christ) to save the world (John 1:41). The Son of God, Jesus Christ, came to earth to die in our place. Because He lived a life without sin, only He was qualified to pay for our sins by His death on a cross. He then demonstrated His power over death when He rose from the grave three days later. Only through Jesus can our sins can be forgiven and we can come to God (Acts 4:12). Jesus Christ is the Savior of everyone in the world (John 3:16).

</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>5. JESUS PERFORMS MIRACLES.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All through his time on earth, Jesus performed miracles. He healed the sick (Matthew 8:16 among many other instances), controlled the weather (Mark 4:39), multiplied food (Matthew 14:14-21), and provided money when needed (Matthew 17:24-27). Even after leaving the earth, He still does miracles in people’s lives (Acts 3:12-16).
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>6. JESUS CHANGES LIVES.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People who followed Jesus turned away from their sins. He cast seven demons out of Mary Magdalene (Luke 8:2) and she became a devoted follower who told others that Jesus had risen from the dead (John 20:16). Zaccheus, a tax collector, repaid people whom he cheated when collecting taxes and gave half of everything else to the poor (Luke 19:1-10). When followers were filled with the power of the Holy Spirit, they were able to declare the message of Jesus, perform miracles, and live free from sin (Luke 10:1-20).

For nearly 2,000 years, Jesus Christ has been changing the lives of people all over the world. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come (2 Corinthians 5:17 ESV). He can change your life as well. Jesus will deliver you from sin’s addiction (Romans 6:22), renew your mind (Romans 12:2), and heal your hurts (2 Thessalonians 2:16-17).

Would you like to pray to receive Jesus into your life?
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>7. JESUS LIVES IN HEAVEN AT FATHER GOD’S RIGHT HAND.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After Jesus rose from the dead, He ascended to heaven to the place where he was before becoming human. From there he is able to hear our prayers (Romans 8:34).
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>8. JESUS WILL RETURN TO JUDGE ALL HUMANITY.</h3><br>
<p class="font">

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While he was still on this earth, Jesus said, Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man [a title Jesus used for Himself], and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory (Matthew 24:30 ESV). When Jesus returns, He will separate those who will live with Him forever in heaven from those who will be punished (Matthew 25:31-33).
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>9. JESUS CHRIST WILL RECEIVE YOU IF YOU COME TO HIM.</h3><br>
<p class="font">
 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jesus said, Whoever comes to me I will never cast out (John 6:37 ESV). This was why He came to earth—to seek and to save the lost (Luke 19:10 ESV). It does not matter what you have done, Jesus still wants you to come to Him. He said, I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance (Luke 5:32 ESV).

        <h3> DEVADAS AYAGAARU</h3>
        <p class="font">

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; St. M. <b>Deva Das</b> is the founder of <b>‘The Bible Mission’</b> a fast growing denomination in <b>South India</b>. He remained as a bachelor 
          throughout his life of 120 years. He is a mystic with many spiritual experiences which are very peculiar to common Christianity. St. M. <b>Deva Das</b>
          was <b><i>born in 1840 to Jonah and Satyavatamma</i></b>, in <b>Jegurupadu</b>, a small village in <i>East Godavari</i> district of <b>Andhra Pradesh</b>.
          He grew up in the best spiritual atmosphere which his parents provided. He was always contemplative while his young mates engulfed themselves in playing 
          and making merry.
    
            <br><br>
    
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; St. M. <b>Deva Das</b> grew up in the humble and rustic surroundings of the Godavari delta region of Andhra Pradesh. His parents are evangelists. 
          They are not very rich in worldly matters. But they are far wealthier in many spiritual aspects who used to spend their time in prayer and 
          intercession every day till late night. As they did not beget children after many years of their marriage, in their old age God gave them 
          the glorious gift i.e. a boy child, whom they named as <b>‘Devadas’</b> which means <b>‘Servant of God’</b> He used to follow his parents, 
          in their evangelistic tours and strictly observe their meditative line up by being straight on his kneels. He received God’s special calling 
          during these times.
    
          <br><br>
    
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he was <b>6 years old</b>, his parents took him to a pastors get-together. When a <b>missionary asked him to pray</b> there he prayed: <b>“Lord 
          Jesus,Let me be like Thee when you are in my age</b>.” From then onwards <b><i>the missionaries had a special impression on child Devadas</i></b>. 
          Missionary Patronage: <b>After completing his primary education, his parents took him to the Lutheran Missionaries at (N.M.E.L..C)</b> Nigam Memorial 
          Evangelical Lutheran Church, at <b>Dhavaleswaram</b> on the banks of river Godavari, and left him under their patronage for further education and 
          spiritual growth.There he finished his 8th standard and qualified to be a Higher grade teacher. Having closely watched his innate zeal and strong 
          sense of determination to serve the Lord, the Lutheran missionaries immediately absorbed him in the teaching faculty of their mission schools.
    
          <br><br>
    
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is always loyal to his authorities and is of excellent disposition towards his superiors. His ideal life is a serene acme for the growing 
          children to be punctual, sincere and humble. He marvelled his authorities in all the challenging responsibilities that are entrusted to him.
          This section deals with the personality of Father Devadas. <b>It tries to understand</b> him, his works and teachings from a typical point of 
          view that describes his maturity of mind and perfection of body.
